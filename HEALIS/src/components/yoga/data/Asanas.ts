Bend the right leg and place the sole of the foot flat against the inner left thigh with the heel pressing the perineum (the area midway between the genitals and anus). Bend the left leg. Push the toes and the outer edge of the left foot into the space between the right calf and thigh muscles. If necessary, this space may be enlarged slightly by using the hands or temporarily adjusting the position of the right leg. Place the left ankle directly over the right ankle so that the ankle bones are touching and the heels are one above the other. Press the pubis with the left heel directly above the genitals. The genitals will therefore lie between the two heels. If this last position is too difficult, simply place the left heel as near as possible to the pubis. Grasp the right toes and pull them up into the space between the left calf and thigh. Again adjust the body so that it is comfortable. Sit on top of the right heel. This is an important aspect of 100 siddhasana. Adjust the body until it is comfortable and the pressure of the heel is firmly applied. The legs should now be locked, with the knees touching the ground and the left heel directly above the right heel. Make the spine erect and feel as though the body is fixed on the floor. Place the hands on the knees in jnana, chin or chinmaya mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Siddhasana may be performed with either leg \nuppermost. Many people experience discomfort due to \nthe pressure applied where the ankles cross each other. If \nnecessary, place a folded cloth or piece of sponge between \nthe legs at this point.

      "benefits": "Siddhasana directs the energy from the lower psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras.

Forceful inhalation results from fully expanding the\nabdominal muscles and forceful exhalation from firm\ncontraction of the abdominal muscles. Do not strain.\nDuring inhalation, the diaphragm descends and the\nabdomen moves outward. During exhalation, the diaphragm moves upward and the abdomen moves inward.\nThe movements should be slightly exaggerated.\nContinue in this manner, counting 10 breaths.\nTake a deep breath in and breathe out slowly.\nThis is one round. Practise up to 5 rounds",
      "benefits": "This practice burns up toxins and helps balance the\ndoshas or humours: kapha, phlegm; pitta, bile; and vata,\nwind. It is a useful practice for women during labour after\na few months of proper preparation.\nBecause of the rapid exchange of air in the lungs, there is\nan increase in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\ninto and out of the bloodstream. This stimulates the\nmetabolic rate, producing heat and flushing out wastes\nand toxins. The rapid and rhythmic movement of the\ndiaphragm also massages and stimulates the visceral\norgans, toning the digestive system.\nBhastrika reduces the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.\nIt helps to alleviate inflammation in the throat and any\naccumulation of phlegm. It balances and strengthens the\nnervous system, inducing peace, tranquillity and onepointedness of mind in preparation for meditation.",
      "contraindications": "Bhastrika should not be practised by\npeople with high blood pressure, heart disease, hernia,\ngastric ulcer, stroke, epilepsy, retinal problems, glaucoma\nor vertigo. The elderly, those suffering from lung diseases\nsuch as asthma and chronic bronchitis, those recovering\nfrom tuberculosis, or in the first trimester of pregnancy\nare recommended to practise only under the guidance of\na competent teacher.",
      "breathing": "Beginners may take several free breaths between\nrounds so that there is no strain.\nBreathing may be practised at 3 breath rates: slow, medium\nand fast, depending on individual capacity.\nSlow bhastrika is approximately one breath every 2 seconds,\nwith no undue force on inhalation or exhalation. It is like\namplified normal breathing. It is especially useful for\nbeginners, but may also be practised at all stages.\nMedium breathing increases the speed of respiration to\napproximately one breath every second.\nFast breathing means a speed of around 2 breaths per\nsecond. Both medium and fast breathing are suitable for\nintermediate and advanced practitioners.\nAs abdominal muscles become stronger with regular\npractice, the number of respirations may be increased by 5\nper month until the count of 50 respirations is attained.",

      "description": "Sit in padmasana or siddha/siddha yoni asana with the\nhead and spine straight. The knees should be in firm\ncontact with the floor.\nPlace the palms of the hands on the knees.\nClose the eyes and relax the whole body.\nInhale slowly and deeply, and retain the breath inside.\nWhile retaining the breath, bend the head fotward and\npress the chin tightly against the chest.\nStraighten the arms and lock them firmly into position,\npressing the knees down with the hands.\nSimultaneously, hunch the shoulders upward and fotward.\nThis will ensure that the arms stay locked, thus intensifying\nthe pressure applied to the neck.\nStay in the final position for a few seconds to begin with.\nDo not strain.\nRelax the shoulders, bend the arms and slowly release the\nlock. Raise the head and then exhale.\nRepeat when the respiration has returned to norntal.",
      "benefits": "The full form of jalandhara bandha compresses the\ncarotid sinuses, which are located on the carotid arteries,\nthe main arteries in the neck. The simple variation exerts\na subtler pressure. These sinuses help to regulate the\ncirculatory and respiratory systems. Normally, a decrease\nin oxygen and increase in carbon dioxide in the body leads\nto an increased heart rate and heavier breathing. This\nprocess is initiated by the carotid sinuses. By exerting\npressure on these sinuses, this tendency is prevented,\nallowing for decreased heart rate and increased breath\nretention. This practice produces mental relaxation,\nrelieving stress, anxiety and anger. It develops meditative\nintroversion and one-pointedness. The stimulus on the\nthroat helps to balance thyroid function and regulate the\nmetabolism.",
      "contraindications": "People suffering from cervical spon-\ndylosis, high intracranial pressure, vertigo, high blood\npressure or heart disease should not practise jalandhara\nbandha. Although the neck lock reduces blood pressure,\nlong retention of the breath strains the heart.\nJalandhara is the first bandha to be taught as the effects\nare light and soothing. Refrain from the practice if any\nvertigo or dizziness arises.",

      "description": "A special neti lota, 'neti pof should be used. This\npot may be made of plastic, pottery, brass or any other\nmetal which does not contaminate the water. The nozzle\non the end of the spout should fit comfortably into the\nnostril so that the water does not leak out. Even a teapot\nmay be used if the tip of the spout is not too large or sharp.\nThe water should be pure, at body temperature and\nthoroughly mixed with salt in the proportion of one\nteaspoonful per half litre of water. The addition of salt\nensures the osmotic pressure of the water is equal to that of\nthe body fluids, thereby minimizing any irritation to the\nmucous membrane. A painful or burning sensation is an\nindication of too little or too much salt in the water.\nStage I: Washing the nostrils\nFill the neti pot with the prepared salt water.\nStand squarely, with legs apart so that the body weight is\nevenly distributed between the feet. Lean fonvard and tilt\nthe head to one side.\nBreathe through the mouth.\nGently insert the nozzle into the uppermost nostril.\nThere should be no force involved.\nThe nozzle should press firmly against the side of the\nnostril so that no water leakage occurs.\nTilt the neti pot in such a way that water runs into the\nnostril and not down the face.\nKeep the mouth open. Raising the elbow of the hand\nwhich holds the neti pot helps to adjust the body position\nso that the water flows out through the lower nostril.\nWhen half the water has passed through the nostrils,\nremove the nozzle from the nostril, centre the head and\nlet the water run out of the nose.\nRemove any mucus from the nose by b1owing gently.\nTilt the head to the opposite side and repeat the process,\nplacing the nozzle of the Iota in the upper nostril.\nAfter completing this process, the nostrils must be\nthoroughly dried.\nStage 2: Drying the nostrils\n1. Stand erect.\nClose the right nostril with the right thumb and breathe\nin and out through the left nostril 10 times in quick\nsuccession, as in kapalbhati pranayama.\nRepeat through the right nostril, with the left nostril closed.\nPerform once more through both nostrils.\n2. Bend fmward from the waist so that the trunk is\nhorizontal.\nRepeat the same process as described above, but tilt the\nhead to the right, closing the right nostril.\nRepeat again, tilting the head to the left and closing the\nleft nostril.\nFinally, repeat again with the head centred, breathing\nthrough both nostrils.Stand erect with the feet apart. Close the right nostril and\nexhale forcefully while bending fotward rapidly from the\nwaist. Inhale normally while returning to the upright\nposition. Repeat 5 times.\nRepeat with the right nostril open and then with both\nnostrils open. Do not blow the nose too hard as the\nremaining water may be pushed into the ears.\nIf necessary, perform shashankasana for several minutes\nto allow the drainage of any remaining water.",
      "benefits": "J ala neti removes mucus and pollution from the\nnasal passages and sinuses, allowing air to flow without\nobstruction. It helps prevent and manage respiratory tract\ndiseases. It helps to maintain good health of the ears, eyes\nand throat.\nJala neti relieves muscular tension of the face and helps\nthe practitioner to maintain a fresh and youthful appear-\nance. It has a calming and soothing influence on the brain.\nIt alleviates anxiety, anger and depression, removes\ndrowsiness and makes the head feel light and fresh.\nJala neti stimulates the various nerve endings in the nose,\nimproving the sense of smell and the overall health of the\nindividual. A balance is brought about between the right\nand left nostrils and the corresponding left and right brain\nhemispheres, inducing a state of harmony and balance\nthroughout the body and mind. Most importantly, however,\nneti helps to awaken ajna chakra.",
      "contraindications": "People who suffer from chronic bleeding in\nthe nose should not do jala neti without the advice of a\ncompetent teacher. Those who-consistently have great diffi-\nculty passing water through the nose may have a structural\nblockage and should seek expert advice.

This is the original form of the\npractice called vyutkrama kapalbhati, or usha paan, which\nliterally means 'water of the dawn'.\nOther liquids may also be used instead of water for the\npractice of neti. These include warm milk - dugdh neti,\nwarm clarified butter or ghee - ghrita neti, and yoghurt. If\noil is used instead of ghee, it must be natural and without\nadded chemicals. The most powerful form of neti is\npractised with the midflow of one's own urine, and is known\nas amaroli neti. This form is particularly useful for alleviating\ninflammation of the nasal passages. Each liquid bestows a\ndifferent benefit. None of these variations should be\nattempted unless instructed by a competent teacher.",

Always keep the tip pointing downward towards the\nbase of the nose. Never push the catheter straight up\nbecause the nasal cavity is behind the nose, not at the top\nof the nose.\nWhen the thread reaches the back of the throat, insert the\nindex finger and thutnb, or the middle and index fingers,\ninto the mouth.\nPull the catheter or thread gently and slowly out through\nthe mouth, leaving a few inches of thread hanging out of\nthe nostril.\nThis action may cause retching at first, but it will become\neasier with practice.\nHold each end of the sutra or catheter with the fingers.\nVery slowly and gently pull it backward and fotward, no\nmore than 15 times on the first attempt.\nRemove it slowly through the nose and repeat the process\nwith the opposite nostril.",
